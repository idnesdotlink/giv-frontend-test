# Vue Js Form Builder

1. Please use this json as form schema

   ```json
   {{ schemajson }}
   ```

2. Based on that json schema, use vue js to render it as html.

   - Using dynamic component will be a plus
   - Using slot, ref, and props will be a plus
   - Must be in Vue component based
   - Combining it with other plugins like select2, datepicker will be a big plus
   - Please beautify the ui if possible
   - Able to add extra field types will be appreciated.

3. Put all value of fields in one json object, for example

   ```json
   {{ outputjson }}
   ```
